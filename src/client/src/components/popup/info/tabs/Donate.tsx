                This site costs money to run. I personally cover the price of running the server, 
                as well as the price of each request to Mapbox, which supports the
                map functionality on the site.

                I (will eventually) have a ko-fi where you can throw a few dollars 
                my way if you'd like to donate to the site's continued existence!

                Additionally, if you have money to spare, I would highly 
                recommend donating to those in Gaza currently experiencing
                an extreme humanitarian crisis and ongoing genocide.
