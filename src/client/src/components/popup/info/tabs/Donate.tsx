                This site costs money to run. I personally cover the price of running the server, 
                as well as the price of each request to Mapbox, which supports the
                map functionality on the site.

                I have a ko-fi where you can throw a few dollars 
                my way if you'd like to donate to the site's continued existence. 
                Forever grateful to all the lovely individuals who have supported the site so far!

                Additionally, if you have money to spare, I would highly 
                recommend donating to those in Gaza currently experiencing
                an extreme humanitarian crisis and ongoing genocide.

                GazaFunds.com provides a collection of GoFundMes for people seeking

                Connecting Humanity connects people in Gaza with donated eSIMs. These eSIMs
                allow them to access the internet and connect with their loved ones. You can either
                purchase an eSIM directly by following Connecting Humanity's instructions, or donate
                money to Crips for eSIMs for Gaza, who
                will use your donation to purchase eSIMs.
