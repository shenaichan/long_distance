                My deepest gratitude to all at the Recurse Center for housing and 
                nurturing me and this project. Thank you to everyone who listened 
                to my ideas, pointed me in the right direction, and helped me through 
                frustrating bugs, including, but certainly not limited to: Ian Fisher, 
                Rhys Hiltner, Sharp Hall, Margot Kriery, Aurora Nou, Justin Bennett, 
                Lucy McPhail, Julian Ordaz, Jeremy Kaplan, and many others. 
                Making this was a great endeavor, and I'm happy to call it my brainchild, but it truly does take a village. 
            </p>

                The site was inspired by <a href="https://www.queeringthemap.com/">QueeringtheMap.com</a>, a "community generated 
                counter-mapping platform for digitally archiving LGBTQ2IA+ experience in 
                relation to physical space". Their vision and mission provided a rock-solid
                foundation upon which my own ideas flourished, and for that, I am deeply thankful.
            </p>

                Thank you to Ada Martin, for being my bedrock, my love, my angel. Thank you
                for reminding me there is always someone in my corner; 
                for coming over to encourage, critique, and suggest features for the site;
                and most importantly, for listening to me constantly complain about the TypeScript linter.
            </p>

                And thank you to Caroline Pastrano. 
                In Gabrielle Zevin's <em>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</em>, 
                she writes, 
                "To design a game is to imagine the person who will eventually play it."
                I designed this website for thousands, and at the same time I designed it for just one person. 
                I hope you know that I miss you every day, and that I love you all 1,800 miles of distance.
